First, install the dependencies. We use [bun](https://bun.sh/) as the package manager.

```bash
bun install
```

To learn more about the folder structure of an Astro project, refer to [our guide on project structure](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/).

```bash
bun dev
```

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
