First, install the dependencies. We use [bun](https://bun.sh/) as the package manager.

```bash
bun install
```

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

```bash
bun dev
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
