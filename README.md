## 💡 Development Notes

This project uses Astro 5, which introduces faster rebuilds, partial hydration improvements, and first-class hybrid rendering.

Svelte is used for dynamic islands and component interactivity.

Tailwind v4 leverages the new @theme token system for consistent color and typography design.

Bun handles dependency management and script execution, replacing Node for faster dev cycles.

Pages are statically generated by default, with selective SSR where necessary.
