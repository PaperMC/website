## The 1.21.5 / 1.21.6 / 1.21.7 Update

It's been a hot minute since the last post, but here we are!  
As always, **backups are absolutely mandatory**.  
**After upgrading your world to 1.21.7, you cannot downgrade back to a lower version!**  
We can also give you a pinky promise that it won't take this long to exit the experimental phase again, and we have already addressed this inflexibility in build channels — more on that below and on our Discord.

We would like to thank everyone that worked on this update:

## Release Channel Changes

Among other changes — and the new V3 of our [Downloads API](https://docs.papermc.io/misc/downloads-api/) — release channels have changed to:

1. `alpha`: Equivalent to the prior `experimental` label
2. `beta`: New middle-point for builds that aren't entirely unstable but partially unfinished (e.g., missing config options or, as with the long 1.21.5 phase, missing datafixer changes)
3. `stable`: Equivalent to the prior `default` label — **always make sure you stay up-to-date with new builds here, as important fixes and changes continue being pushed**
4. `recommended`: **Unused in Paper**, but currently used for Velocity releases. If this ever changes, we will announce it beforehand.

## `force-upgrade` Startup Param

Time and time again, issues in old world upgrade code are found, with fairly important issues having been fixed by Mojang or Paper in recent versions.  
If you use the `--forceUpgrade` startup flag, you lose out on fixes from future versions, since it forcefully loads and upgrades all worlds and entities.

Only if you are updating from a version **before 1.13** should you use force-upgrade, as it can save some performance during expensive conversions.  
In that case, the safer option is to force-upgrade on **Paper 1.21.7**, but you should **otherwise never force upgrade without a specific reason.**

## Reloading with `/reload`

For many years, the Bukkit reload mechanic has been unofficially deprecated, with big warnings whenever someone triggers it via `/reload` or related API methods.  
We are **officially deprecating** it, to be removed at a later time.

The `/reload` command will now point to `/minecraft:reload`, a reload mechanic that **is** and will stay supported, as it's a Vanilla mechanic.  
Users should stop and start the server when making changes that require a restart.  
Developers should use hot reloading or full restarts instead. For guidance on hotswap, see the pinned messages in our `#paper-dev` Discord channel.

## For Developers

### Configuration Phase API & Deprecation of `PlayerLoginEvent`

The use of `PlayerLoginEvent` is now deprecated.  
This change has been made to allow us to start developing API for the **Configuration Phase** in Minecraft.  
This phase most notably allows dialogs to be sent to the player before they join the game, or resource packs to be sent earlier.  
This is an early warning: while `PlayerLoginEvent` will remain available for now, **breaking changes may be introduced in the future**.  
Plugins relying on this event should begin migrating as soon as possible.

#### What You Should Use Instead

Please migrate to the following events based on your needs:

- `PlayerConnectionValidateLoginEvent`  
  Use this when controlling whether a player should be able to join the game — i.e., logic that previously prevented login via `PlayerLoginEvent`.  
  This event fires twice: once when logging in, and once when exiting the configuration phase.  
  You do **not** have access to a `Player` entity here, only a `PlayerProfile`.

- `PlayerServerFullCheckEvent`  
  Replaces the common `PlayerLoginEvent` use case that allowed players to join even if the server was full.

#### Other Configuration Phase Related Events

The configuration phase occurs **between logging into a server and fully joining a world**.  
During this time, server data — including tags and custom registry elements — is sent to the client.  
You can send custom data or apply a resource pack _before_ they exit the loading screen.

You can also throw a player back into the configuration phase using:

- `PlayerGameConnection#reenterConfiguration`
- `PlayerConfigurationConnection#completeReconfiguration`

New events include:

- `PlayerConnectionInitialConfigureEvent` (when joining initially)
- `AsyncPlayerConnectionConfigureEvent`
- `PlayerConnectionReconfigureEvent` (when re-entering configuration)

## Dialog API

Dialog API will be merged into 1.21.7 soon — we’ll post a dev announcement once it’s in!  
You can see its current status here:

- [Compare changes](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper/compare/ab1b472c5663f4123632770db8ea509b9be49e20..11a1e0ffd25be0224c878ebaf629191863264861)
- [Pull Request #12671](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper/pull/12671)

You will also be able to open dialogs via a new click event type using `ClickEvent.openDialog`.  
For custom click actions, you may use `PlayerCustomClickEvent`, but the preferred option is to directly pass a callback in `DialogAction.customClick`, which will be run when the player clicks the specified element.

## ItemStack Config Serialization

`ItemStack`s now use the **SNBT format** when written to configuration files.  
This allows ItemStacks to run upgrades through Minecraft's data fixers for more reliable migrations.

Direct serialization of `ItemMeta` (storing raw `ItemMeta` in a config) is now considered unsupported and may be removed in the future.  
If you want to serialize items to other formats, such as JSON or raw bytes, the `(de)serializeStack` methods on `UnsafeValues` may be of interest.

## Cow and Splash Potion Type Changes

Cow inheritance has been adjusted to fit Vanilla:

- `MushroomCow` no longer extends `Cow`, but the new `AbstractCow`
- `Cow` now extends `AbstractCow`

Additionally, the `potion` entity type has been split into **splash** and **lingering** potion entities.  
You must now use those specific entity types and can no longer swap between them without creating a new entity.

## Other API Additions and Changes

A small selection of recent API additions that may be interesting:

- [Registry events](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/dev/registries/) for modifying or adding custom cat, chicken, cow, frog, pig, and wolf variants, as well as damage types and paintings
- `Player#openVirtualSign` to open unplaced signs (changes via `UncheckedSignChangeEvent`)
- `Entity#getPickItemStack` to get the spawn egg/item for an entity when using the pick action
- `HumanEntity#setCooldown(Key, int ticks)` and getter for grouped cooldowns (not per-item)
- `Server#sendRichMessage(String)` and `sendPlainMessage` for broadcasting and logging text
- New events including:
  - `PlayerMapFilledEvent`
  - `PlayerPickBlockEvent`
  - `PlayerPickEntityEvent`
  - `VaultChangeStateEvent`
  - `ClientTickEndEvent`
  - `EntityEquipmentChangedEvent`
  - `EntityAttemptSmashAttackEvent`
  - `PlayerClientLoadedWorldEvent`
  - `EntityEffectTickEvent`
