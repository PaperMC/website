### Minecraft versioning changes

Starting in 2026, [Mojang is changing their versioning scheme](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-new-version-numbering-system). In short, it will start with the current year, then the drop number within that year, possibly followed by patch and hotfix numbers. I.e. the first drop in 2026 will be `26.1` and its first hotfix would be `26.1.1`. If you do any sort of Minecraft version parsing that expects a version to start with `1.`, make sure to prepare for this change.

### Unobfuscated server jars

Starting with 26.1, Mojang will no longer provide obfuscated server jars and instead have them contain all class, method, field names etc.
Now is a good time to make sure your plugins are able to run on server jars that are not obfuscated.
You can do this by starting a 1.21.11 Paper server using the `-Dpaper.disablePluginRemapping=true` startup flag and removing the `reobfJar` step from your [paperweight-userdev config](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/dev/userdev/#compiling-to-mojang-mappings).
As spigot is moving to unobfuscated server jars for 26.1 as well, we are **dropping** the spigot internal remapper in 26.1.
If your plugin is still using spigot mappings, migrate immediately as your plugin will not be working on either spigot or paper 26.1.
