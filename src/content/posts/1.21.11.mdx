### Minecraft versioning changes

Starting in 2026, [Mojang is changing their versioning scheme](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-new-version-numbering-system). In short, it will start with the current year, then the drop number within that year, possibly followed by patch and hotfix numbers. I.e. the first drop in 2026 will be `26.1` and its first hotfix would be `26.1.1`. If you do any sort of Minecraft version parsing that expects a version to start with `1.`, make sure to prepare for this change.

### Unobfuscated server jars

Starting with the first version after 1.21.11, Mojang will no longer provide obfuscated server jars and instead have them contain all class, method, field names etc. Now is a good time to make sure your plugins are able to run on server jars that are not obfuscated. You can do this by starting a 1.21.10 Paper server using the `-Dpaper.disablePluginRemapping=true` startup flag and removing the `reobfJar` step from your [paperweight-userdev config](https://docs.papermc.io/paper/dev/userdev/#compiling-to-mojang-mappings).
