PaperMC participates in DigitalOcean's Hacktoberfest event. We accept meaningful contributions to almost all of our projects - just make sure the repository has the **hacktoberfest** topic set! You can use a query like [this](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Apapermc+topic%3Ahacktoberfest) to show all of our repositories that have the topic added.

We love getting contributions to Paper, but we'd also love some attention for our documentation (a great way to contribute if you are not that familiar with Java!)
If you want to contribute to any of our repositories that don't have the **hacktoberfest** topic set, just message us and we'll look into adding it.

As with last year, we don't accept minor typos or similar PRs during October. We do not want to encourage PR spam, so please only contribute if you actually have a meaningful addition.
