We've seen a lot of reports of a new malware going around Minecraft servers. It seems to be spread by compromised Spigot plugin-author accounts, and is somewhat difficult to detect. We do know that the following exception is caused by it:

`java.net.NoRouteToHostException: No route to host`

If you see this in your logs, that server is most likely infected. There are other indicators too - the compromised JAR will have inside of it a file called plugin-config.bin. We do have a one-liner for searching for this in your plugin directories, if you're on a Linux system:

`grep -R "plugin-config.bin" .`

If you're on a Windows system you can run this command in your plugins directory:

```
findstr /sml /c:"plugin-config.bin" *
```

Run the above while in your server or plugin directory, and if you get a match, you likely have an infected plugin. If you do not get a match, that is a good thing - you are likely not infected.

@Optic_Fusion1 's AntiMalware tool on https://github.com/OpticFusion1/MCAntiMalware has caught onto this malware about a month ago already and catches more variants of it. We highly suggest users run this tool as it contains checks for a lot more malware sources. If this tool reports any malware found, be sure to double check whether it's a false positive or not (known example: ForceOP check falsely triggers on a handful of plugins because of how it's used in plugins).

If you do get a match or think that you are infected, you should **delete all of your JAR files and re-download them**, as the malware spreads itself to other JARs. You should also **immediately reinstall your machine**, as this malware is known to install system services outside of Minecraft. It might be more effort, **but it is important that infected machines are reinstalled, or else the malware will remain**.

If you frequently download plugins from third-party sources e.g. SpigotMC, it's not a bad idea to do routine checks with this tool e.g. once a month or so. **Remember to only download reputable plugins from reputable sources & authors.**

Keep an eye out, and thanks.
