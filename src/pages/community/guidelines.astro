    <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-4">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      PaperMC has grown significantly past what it was originally created to
      be â€” a small group of tightly-knit developers having fun on a side
      project, never really intending it to go anywhere. With this fact in
      mind, we need to be proactive and explicit about how we intend to combat
      negativity and toxicity in the PaperMC community. We want PaperMC to be
      a welcoming community to all, where new members feel safe to hang out
      and ask questions, and where old members are happy to hang out, chat,
      and help others too. We want PaperMC to be an inclusive environment.
      PaperMC is, at its core, a development community. We want to continue
      staying focused on being a development community rather than letting
      toxic behavior take over. This document is the definitive list of
      guidelines everyone in the community must follow to participate in this
      community.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-4">The PaperMC Community</h2>
    <p>
      This document uses the phrase &quot;PaperMC community&quot; to refer to
      all communication which happens within the PaperMC ecosystem. This
      includes every forum of communication that is officially part of the
      PaperMC project. To be abundantly clear, these PaperMC Community
      Guidelines apply to all of the following:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside my-4">
      <li>The PaperMC Discord server</li>
      <li>The PaperMC IRC channels</li>
      <li>The PaperMC forums</li>
      <li>The PaperMC GitHub organization</li>
      <li>
        This includes issues, pull requests, and any discussion inside issues
        or pull requests
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-4">Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
      PaperMC has a fairly short and sweet set of rules. It generally comes
      down to:
    </p>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside my-4 ml-4">
      <li>Don&apos;t be a jerk</li>
      <li>Listen to project staff</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      We do this because creating an exhaustive list for all negative behavior
      we want to avoid is impossible and likely won&apos;t help anyways. The
      kinds of people who would engage in such a way in the first place
      probably aren&apos;t the people we want around at all.
      <br />
      <br />
      However, there are specific behaviors we want to avoid in our community.
      The following behaviors are not permitted in the PaperMC community:
    </p>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside my-4 ml-4 space-y-2 py-1">
      <li>
        Using language or posting content that can reasonably be considered
        discriminatory.
        <ol class="list-alpha list-inside ml-6 space-y-2 py-1">
          <li>
            Most of the language banned here should be obvious, but will be
            listed in more detail below in{" "}
            <a
              href="#zero-tolerance-items"
              class="text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-300"
            >
              Zero Tolerance Items.
            </a>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Posting pornographic, distasteful, or excessively violent content.
        <ol class="list-alpha list-inside ml-6 space-y-2 py-1">
          <li>This is similar to the first rule.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Spamming or excessively sending messages, including repeating
        questions, resending links too frequently, or posting the same
        question to multiple channels.
        <ol class="list-alpha list-inside ml-6 space-y-2 py-1">
          <li>
            Spam bots and trolling users will be immediately banned without
            warning.
          </li>
          <li>
            Incessantly repeating questions because they&apos;re not being
            answered isn&apos;t allowed. Please be patient in waiting for a
            reply.
            <ol class="list-roman list-inside ml-6 space-y-2 py-1">
              <li>
                Repeating a question after some time has passed because the
                question is no longer current and the conversation has changed
                is fine, as long as it&apos;s not too repetitive.
              </li>
              <li>
                Repeating a question because the answer given isn&apos;t
                satisfying is not fine.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Trying to buy or sell services or hire developers. This is not a
        marketplace.
      </li>
      <li>
        Formatting usernames to be difficult to read, to impersonate others,
        to advertise, or to be inappropriate.
        <ol class="list-alpha list-inside ml-6 space-y-2 py-1">
          <li>
            Non-hateful and non-bigoted cursing is fine for the most part, but
            not in usernames. Constant cursing in every message isn&apos;t
            allowed. Usernames containing curse words are basically the same
            as saying that word every time a message is sent, so it&apos;s the
            same problem.
          </li>
          <li>
            Impersonating people includes anyone in or out of the server, not
            just staff and not just those in Paper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Putting servers or plugins in usernames isn&apos;t allowed.
            However, this is allowed in less visible fields, such as a Discord
            status.
          </li>
          <li>
            Usernames that are nothing but a bunch of symbols that are
            impossible to pronounce aren&apos;t very conducive of a good
            conversation environment. However, this does not apply to
            usernames in different languages and alphabets. There is a
            difference between having a username in Japanese and having only
            random symbols as your username.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Pinging server staff, moderators, or contributors without a valid
        reason.
        <ol class="list-alpha list-inside ml-6 space-y-2 py-1">
          <li>
            For reporting dupe glitches or critical bugs, please make use of
            the &quot;paper-exploit-report&quot; channel on Discord. This
            notifies the developers and keeps the issue confidential. This
            channel isn&apos;t for regular support.
          </li>
          <li>
            Someone pinging a particular person because they are responding to
            that person isn&apos;t a problem. Someone pinging a project
            developer or contributor just because they want an answer is what
            is addressed here.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are some users who don&apos;t want to be pinged, so please
            respect their decision.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Discussing politics or political controversy. We prohibit this in
        order to prevent the degeneration of our chat channels.
        <ol class="list-alpha list-inside ml-6 space-y-2 py-1">
          <li>
            This does not apply to speaking about everyday lives or current
            events - only when discussion devolves to the point of being
            solely about some political scandal or controversy.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Discussing piracy or pirated software. This explicitly applies to
        &quot;offline-mode&quot; (not authenticating users against their
        Microsoft accounts) as well.
        <ol class="list-alpha list-inside ml-6 space-y-2 py-1">
          <li>
            This does not apply to legitimate uses of offline mode, like with
            certain proxies, as long as the users get authenticated with
            Microsoft another way.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Discussing the bypassing or exploiting of Minecraft&apos;s player
        safety features in any way that is malicious or harmful. This applies
        to discussion around how to bypass chat, username, and skin reporting
        specifically, as well as any other features that make Minecraft a
        safer place for its users.
        <ol class="list-alpha list-inside ml-6 space-y-2 py-1">
          <li>
            This does not apply to general discussion of the safety features
            themselves, nor does it apply to discussion of these
            features&apos; potential downsides. Further we will not forbid
            general discussion of &apos;proper&apos; ways to disable safety
            features for legitimate reasons. Only trying to bypass them for
            the sake of avoiding accountability or otherwise being malicious
            isn&apos;t allowed.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      If someone is violating those feel free to use the <code>@mods</code>{" "}
      ping on Discord to notify the moderation team. You can also contact the
      team privately using the <code>/modmail</code> command or sending a
      direct message to our bot <code>Pencil#7974 (811281085723705395)</code>,
      however this does not alert us in the same way that the{" "}
      <code>@mods</code> ping does, so don&apos;t use it for time sensitive
      issues.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-4">Zero Tolerance Items</h2>
    <p>
      Particularly severe issues represent a behavior and a kind of person we
      don&apos;t want associated with PaperMC in any way. These behaviors will
      result in an immediate ban without warning:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside my-4 ml-4">
      <li>Racial slurs or racist speech</li>
      <li>Sexist slurs or sexist speech</li>
      <li>Homophobic or transphobic slurs or speech</li>
      <li>
        Ableist slurs or speech &mdash; there&apos;s confusion around this
        term, so to help clarify:
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6 py-1">
          <li>
            Ableist slurs are words that refer to people with disabilities
            used as insults
          </li>
          <li>
            Ableist speech is hate speech directed towards people with
            disabilities
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Any other hate speech not already listed</li>
      <li>Doxxing people</li>
      <li>Personal attacks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This list is not exhaustive. If someone is engaging in bad behavior not
      conducive to a friendly environment, and we believe it warrants an
      immediate ban, then we will do so.
      <br />
      <br />
      When someone is removed for violating one of these items, all messages
      in question will be removed as well and reported to Discord if
      necessary.

      Topic Specific Channels on Discord
    </h2>
    <p>
      PaperMC has channels dedicated to specific topics, and conversations in
      these channels should stay on-topic. This can help newer members in
      particular to feel more comfortable asking questions in the help
      channels if other members aren&apos;t also talking over them about
      other, unrelated topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moderators will shut down any off-topic discussions happening in any of
      the following channels and ask for the conversation to be moved to{" "}
      <code>#general</code> instead:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside my-4 ml-4">
      <li>
        <code>#paper-help</code>
      </li>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-4">Support Channels</h2>
    <p>
      Our support channels <code>#paper-help</code>,{" "}
      <code>#velocity-help</code>, <code>#waterfall-help</code> and{" "}
      <code>#folia-help</code> are there for people who need support using our
      software. While we are very happy that so many members of the community
      actively support there and answer questions, please make sure to follow
      our guidelines there as well. Many people that go there to ask questions
      are new to Minecraft servers and to the community itself. We should be
      welcoming towards newcomers, especially since we all started somewhere.
      In general, &quot;Rule 1: Don&apos;t be a jerk&quot; applies here as
      well, but we would like to add the following points:
    </p>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside my-4 ml-4 space-y-2">
      <li>
        Please don&apos;t harass people for using software/plugins that you
        don&apos;t like. We know that some plugins are not that well received
        in this community, but as long as they are not causing the issue
        itself, you shouldn&apos;t harass people for using them. This
        doesn&apos;t mean that you can&apos;t recommend a replacement. Again,
        as stated in rule 1, if you don&apos;t like if someone is using a
        specific software, you can always choose to just ignore the question
        and let someone else answer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Please be polite even when turning down help. PaperMC does not
        officially support older versions of our software, and that is not
        likely to change. We generally discourage people from using our older
        software, and we stipulate that it comes with no support. This does
        not mean users asking for support for older versions should be mocked
        or yelled at, however.
      </li>
