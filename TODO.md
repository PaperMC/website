# TODO List

### Navbar Overhaul
- Refactor the navbar into regular CSS/Astro to remove React.
- Consider better approaches for icons (added astro-icon for footer).
- Fix CSS styling for external links not being visible.
- Add back social icons to the navbar.
- Style the navbar for light mode.

### Misc
- Verify if `windicss/plugin/aspect-ratio` is necessary for anything.
- Auto-generate a `sitemap.xml`.

### Team Page & Sponsor Page
- Double-check that the contributor fetching logic is correct.
- Integrate logic for `onError`/`onLoad` for images.
- Fix CSS styling for images (currently looks off).

### Guidelines Page
- Fix the alignment of the CC BY SA icons at the bottom.

### RemoteImageWrapper
- Make any necessary adjustments.

### Software Pages
- Integrate proper prop fetching for version groups and other relevant data.

### Software Header
- Utilize named slots since Waterfall takes in a component for the header and description.
