# TODO List

### Navbar Overhaul

- menu should be default to closed on mobile
- Consider better approaches for icons (added astro-icon for footer). their colors are wrong
- fix social icons not loading
- nav dropdown transition?

### Misc

- Verify if `windicss/plugin/aspect-ratio` is necessary for anything.
- Auto-generate a `sitemap.xml`.

### Team Page & Sponsor Page

- Double-check that the contributor fetching logic is correct.
- Integrate logic for `onError`/`onLoad` for images.
- Fix CSS styling for images (currently looks off).

### Guidelines Page

- Fix the alignment of the CC BY SA icons at the bottom. (kinda fixed, just icons in general are ugly)

### RemoteImageWrapper

- Make any necessary adjustments.

### Software Pages

- Integrate proper prop fetching for version groups and other relevant data.

### Software Header

- Utilize named slots since Waterfall takes in a component for the header and description.

### Software Download

- project icons
- waterfall eol message (similar problem as the software header)
- actual logic, download button, etc
